# MyBela

MyBela is an Android application made in Android Studio using Jetpack Compose and Firebase. The app allows tracking and writing the points for a card game "Bela" and saving all played games in a Firebase database.

To use the app you first need to register an account and then log in. Once logged in you can view all the previous games played, as well as create your own Bela game. You can choose registered players, divide them into teams and select the desired game length. Add more rounds and points until one team reaches the game length. Once the game is completed, all game data is saved in a database which you can see in the "Previous games" screen.

## Installing the app

- Important note: the app is currently not responsive in version 1.0, so unless you have a device with a screen size of 1080x2400 pixels, the app will not display properly

However, if you still wish to install the app, there is an apk in .app/release/ directory which you can download and install or you can run the project in Android Studio and install it there.
